    "[Enigma Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) is the most powerful cipher machine used by Nazi Germany during the World War II. It has an electromechanical design which can scramble 26 Letters. When you press a button the corresponding light according to the enigma setting is lit up. It was invented by [Arthur Scherbius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Scherbius) and [Richard Ritter](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Richard_Ritter).\n",
    "\n",
    "If plain test is entered, it is encoded into ciphertext and if ciphertext is entered the plain text is displayed. The encryption is based on [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).  It is one of the simplest and most widely used encryption techniques. The Alphabet is shifted by $k$ which connects different letters together. This means for a given cipher the letters always correspond to each other.\n",

    "* Steckerbrett - \"Plugboard\" in front of the machine to connect two different letters together. This is an extra scramble layer\n",
    "* Rotors - located between the Plugboard and the Reflector, the three Rotors left, middle and right can be set to a given position to achieve a different scrambling\n",
    "* Reflector - The Reflector receives the signals from the left Rotor and sends it back to him, the Reflector scrambling can not be changed.\n",
