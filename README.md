# Description

inspired by [Tomáš Bouda](https://medium.com/@tomas.bouda) and his [100 days of algorithm](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/100-days-of-algorithms-challenge-41996f7e1ec8) challenge, my attempt on it. Besides my work, my family and other activities this challenge will take me surely longer than 100 days and it can be more or less than 100 algorithms. So be kind.

## Why use Python

The individual challenges should take as less time as possible therefore a high level language such as [Python](https://www.python.org) and all of its available [PIP packages](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and the fantastic note-like development IDE [Jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as sidekick, the focus isn't on the tools but the algorithms.

# Rules

1. Everything can be a algo
2. Make an effort to code everyday
3. Focus on the challenges not the language
4. Get every help possible
5. Have fun :see_no_evil: :hear_no_evil: :speak_no_evil:
